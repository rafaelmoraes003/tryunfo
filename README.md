<p align="left">The goal of this project was to create the game Trunfo using React. For this reason, I needed to know how to handle states and events, in addition to knowing how to use conditional rendering.<br><br>When describing a card, it appears next to it in the form of a preview and, when saving it (this only happens if all fields are filled in and the attribute field meets a minimum and maximum requirement of composition and sum ) the card appears created just below.<br><br>As the application is based on Trump, one of the requirements was to be able to have ONLY 1 Super Trunfo card.<br><br>When the cards are already saved, it is possible to make a search filter by name, rarity and Super Trunfo; in addition, it is also possible to delete cards from the deck.</p>
